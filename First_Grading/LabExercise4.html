    <p>Easily one of the most anticipated collaborations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite" target="_blank">Fortnite</a> has done in a long time, at least based on the 200,000 tweets about it, is the arrival of Hatsune Miku in the game, the virtual musical artist that now has a skin, back bling, emotes and music packs among other things available in the game.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODXMGAMpVc&pp=ygUTd2hvIGlzIGhhdHN1bmUgbWlrdQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku</a> has gone live in the shop changeover, and has two main packs, a 3,200 V-bucks pack with nine items including her skin, which has a reactive version. You can buy her skin separately for 1,500 V-Bucks. </p>
    <p>There is also a Music Pass version where you can unlock ten rewards including an alternate outfit for her. This costs 1,400 <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/V-Bucks" target="_blank">V-Bucks</a>. Why is the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Fortnite such a big deal? She is old school internet royalty. 
    Before the metaverse, before AI, there was Hatsune Miku, a piece of <a href="https://www.vocaloid.com/en/?srsltid=AfmBOor0giQV0s1jSGrL5ULI4u6sQyEXUpwixphW9Qb0-KTI-M1lU0ON" target="_blank">Vocaloid software</a>  that has gone on to perform holographic concerts for huge audiences. She was “born” in 2007 where of course the internet was a very different place it is now, and here in 2025 she has millions of Fortnite players psyched about her arrival. That’s staying power.</p>
    <p>Miku also fits in the with the Japanese theme of this chapter/season which has also featured the likes of <a href="https://godzilla.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopFPmgv9ci6HfppZk3HgDJSp4rqiYhCSLLd4s1eLQoPqUy1xeHW" target="_blank">Godzilla</a> and King Kong, Big Hero 6, <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and other IP from or influenced by the country. So Hatsune Miku fits right in, and that’s also true for her double appearance in Fortnite Festival as a music star. Part of her appeal is the ability to generate songs using her voice, and reportedly it has been used in 100,000 unique songs (though those figures are from 2011). I do wonder if Fortnite may be doing a full-on concert with her at some point, but nothing like that has been announced.</p>
    <p>If Fortnite still has aims to be the <a href="https://about.meta.com/metaverse/" target="_blank">metaverse</a> a collaboration with one of its founders makes a lot of sense. We’ll see how her collection of stuff is received by the community, but from what I’m seeing is so far, so good, in terms of her biggest fans.

        To get everything Miku will run you 4,600 V-Bucks, so she is no small investment. But I have a feeling she’s going to be bringing in quite a bit of cash for Epic by the time her run in the store is over. It’s not clear when or if she will come back, so you might have to jump on the purchase now.</p>
